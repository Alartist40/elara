## Elara v2.0

### Core Architecture
- **CLaRa** — Continuous Latent Reasoning Architecture  
  Based on: "CLaRa: Bridging Retrieval and Generation with Continuous Latent Reasoning" (Apple / University of Edinburgh, 2025)

- **TiDAR** — Think in Diffusion, Talk in Autoregression  
  Hybrid autoregressive + diffusion generation architecture

- **TRM** — Tiny Recursive Model  
  Inspired by Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) and Universal Transformers

### External Components
- **[Mistral Inference](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference)** — Base language model (Apache 2.0)
- **[OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)** — Speech-to-Text (MIT License)
- **[NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)** — Text-to-Speech via FastPitch + HiFi-GAN (Apache 2.0)

### Key Libraries
- **PyTorch** — Deep learning framework
- **safetensors** — Safe model weight serialization
- **bitsandbytes** — Quantization support
- **soundfile / librosa** — Audio processing

### Biblical Principles
Constitutional safety principles are grounded in Scripture. See `config/biblical_principles.yaml` for the full reference with scriptural citations.
